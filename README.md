# -Data-Mining-Using-A-Priori-Algorithm-for-Movie-rentals

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the A Priori algorithm for mining association rules from a movie rentals dataset. The goal is to identify frequent itemsets and generate insights about movie rental patterns.

## What Has Been Done

- Implemented the A Priori algorithm to analyze transactional data from movie rentals.
- Prepared and cleaned the dataset for mining.
- Generated frequent itemsets and association rules.
- Documented the process and results.
- Updated the project and pushed changes to GitHub.

## Assignment Explanation

The assignment involved applying data mining techniques to a real-world scenario using the A Priori algorithm. The steps included:
- Data preparation: Cleaning and formatting the movie rentals dataset for analysis.
- Algorithm implementation: Coding the A Priori algorithm to find frequent itemsets.
- Rule generation: Extracting association rules to uncover relationships between rented movies.
- Result analysis: Interpreting the frequent itemsets and rules to provide actionable insights about customer rental behavior.
